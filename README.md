# resume-cwf
This project is just a LaTeX class for simple resumes. I've included an example use case, and the resulting output, as well.

## Files
- `resume-cwf.cls`: the actual LaTeX class file
- `test-resume.tex`: an example LaTeX file using the resume-cwf document class 
- `test-resume.pdf`: the resulting pdf file for the associated LaTeX example

## Usage
Simply put the `resume-cwf.cls` file in the same directory as your source LaTeX file, and it should work.
